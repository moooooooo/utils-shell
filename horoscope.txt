You did not come to this planet so that you could fit in with what was already happening on it. You were not born to conform. You came here to ask awkward questions, to provoke thought, to explore alternatives and to play a part in a process of positive change. Some people are less than ecstatic about your refusal to accept an assumption. That’s their problem. You must do your best to be kind, considerate and sensitive in the way that you explain yourself, but you can’t just meekly comply with their wishes.
